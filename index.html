    <h1>
A demonstration of the Semantics! library
    </h1>
    <p>
Semantics! is a library for implementing interpreters of structured text, e. g. 
lists, markup or computer languages. I wrote it as a part of another project, 
Barbersynth, but I was more pleased with the interpreter part of that project 
than the rest of it, so I decided to give the interpreter some extra attention 
here. 
    </p>
    <h2>
Interactive gui demo
    </h2>
    <p>
In this document, I will design a simple math language and implement an 
interpreter for that language using the Semantics! library as an demonstration 
of how it works. I will also build a simple calculator to make the interpreter 
interactive. The calculator will look something like this: 
    </p>
    <script>
function Calculator(interpreter, formElement) {
  this.interpreter = interpreter;
  this.input = document.createElement("input");
  this.output = document.createElement("output");
  this.submit = document.createElement("submit");
  this.submit.value = "calculate";
  this.element = formElement;
  formElement.appendChild(this.input);
  formElement.appendChild(this.submit);
  formElement.appendChild(this.output);
  
  formElement.addEventListener("submit", this);
}

Calculator.prototype.handleEvent = function() {
  var userInput = this.input.value;
  var result = this.interpreter.expression(userInput);
  this.output.value = result;
};

describe("The calculator", function() {
  it("calls the interpreter with the content of the input and sets the " + 
  "output to the result", function() {
    var interpreter = {
      expression: function() {
        
      }
      
    };
    
    spyOn(interpreter, "expression").and.returnValue("the result");
    var form = document.createElement("form");
    var calculator = new Calculator(interpreter, form);
    calculator.input.value = "user input";
    
    var submitEvent = new Event("submit");
    calculator.element.dispatchEvent(submitEvent);
    
    expect(interpreter.expression).toHaveBeenCalledWith("user input");
    expect(calculator.output.value).toBe("the result");
  });
});
    </script>
    <pre>
function Calculator(interpreter, formElement) {
  this.interpreter = interpreter;
  this.input = document.createElement("input");
  this.output = document.createElement("output");
  this.submit = document.createElement("submit");
  this.submit.value = "calculate";
  this.element = formElement;
  formElement.appendChild(this.input);
  formElement.appendChild(this.submit);
  formElement.appendChild(this.output);
  
  formElement.addEventListener("submit", this);
}

Calculator.prototype.handleEvent = function() {
  var userInput = this.input.value;
  var result = this.interpreter.expression(userInput);
  this.output.value = result;
};
    </pre>
    <p>
You use it by writing the expression in the left field. When you hit "Calculate" 
it will pass what you have written to the interpreter through its expression 
method. The choise of the name "expression" might seem a little strange, but 
that will be made 
clear later on. The result of the interpretation will be presented in the 
rightmost field. 
    </p>
    <h2>
Terminals and capturing groups
    </h2>
    <p>
The most central component of a math language is the number. In computer 
science and semantics, such a component is called a "terminal". The Semantics! 
library has a way of creating terminals, and I will show how it could be done 
for the number terminal. I will make this as simple as possible as not to 
distract from the demonstration of the functionallity of the library. Therefore 
I will define a number as one or more digits that may start with zeros. 
Semantics uses regular expressions to identify terminals. My definition of a 
number has the regular expression /[0-9]+/.
    </p>
    <p>
In Semantics!, you must use capturing groups, so the expression becomes 
/([0-9]+)/. This has the practical effect that parts of the text that doesn't 
carry any meaning can be left out of the capruring group. For example, I want 
my language to allow for whitespaces. I can easily do this by adding optional 
whitespaces to the regexp, but to left them out of the capturing group that 
defines the part of the text that carries meaning. This makes the new regexp 
/\s*([0-9]+)\s*/. The interpreter will accept spaces, but it wont make any use 
of them. Now we are ready to create our first terminal expression!
    </p>
    <script>
var factory = new InterpreterMethodFactory();

var interpreter = {};
interpreter.expression = factory.terminal(/\s*([0-9]+)\s*/, function(number) {
  return Number(number);
});

describe("A simple expression that just handles integers", function() {
  it("handles integers", function() {
    expect(interpreter.expression("42")).toBe(42);
  });
  
  it("accepts leading zeros", function() {
    expect(interpreter.expression("0042")).toBe(42);
  });
})
    </script>
    <pre>
var factory = new InterpreterMethodFactory();

var interpreter = {};
interpreter.expression = factory.terminal(/\s*([0-9]+)\s*/, function(number) {
  return Number(number);
};
    </pre>
    <p>
Let's go through that step by step. First we create an InterpreterMethodFactory, 
which is an object that makes interpreter methods for other objects. Next we 
create the object that is going to be the interpreter of our language. Then we 
use the method factory to create a new terminal method. To do that, it needs 
two things: the syntax of a number and the semantics of a number. The capturing 
group of the regular expression provides the syntax and the function provides 
the semantics of a number. Numbers have a simple semantic in most languages. It 
just reports its value for the statements around it to use. In the Semantics! 
library, this is accomplished by a return statement. Later on we will see how 
the statements around the number will be notified of its return value, but for 
now it works like this.      
    </p>
    <p>
The terminal method of the factory object will create a new method that is 
supposed to be put on an interpreter object. The created method will accept a
string and match it to the regular expression. Next it will call the supplied 
function as if it where a method of the interpreter object with the captured 
group as argument. Our particular function calls the Number constructor, 
because that is an easy way of converting strings to numbers in javascript. 
Remember that the group captured by the regular expression will be a string, 
not a number. The resulting number of the function will then be returned by the 
expression method of the interpreter. 
    </p>
    <p>
I want you to think of the terminal method as a way of making a function that 
can split a string argument into several string arguments, one per 
capturing group,
    </p>
    <pre>
function(string) {code} + /(capturingGroup1)(capturingGroup2).../ + magic -> 
-> function(match1, match2, ...) {code}
    </pre>
    <p>
or, more formally
    </p>
    <pre>
InterpreterMethodFactory.prototype.terminal = function(regexp, callback) {
  return function(text) {
    var match = regexp.exec(text);
    callback.apply(this, match.slice(1));
  };
};
    </pre>
    <p>
The actuall code is more complicated than this, mostly because of Semantics! 
ability to backtrack alternative interpretations requires it to separate the 
matching step from the execution step. In fact it recursively builds a single 
monolithic instruction from the whole text and executes it. Not very 
efficient, I admit, but if the current part of the code can be interpreted in 
several ways, Semantics! is able to look further in the code to determine which 
of them is the correct one. 
    </p>
    <p>
In fact, Semantics! can handle languageswhere the last letter determines the 
interpretation of the rest of the text. Semantics! will just build an 
instruction for all of the code and discard that instruction if the last letter 
doesn't match, and redo it for all the interpretations corresponding to each 
possible last letter until the last letter matches. Firstly then, anything is 
executed. Since nothing was executed for the wrong interpretations, they will 
leave no side effects. Please don't make such a language.
